In the PyBank challenge I created a Python script for analyzing the financial records of this fictional company. I produced a set of financial data called [budget_data.csv](PyBank/Resources/budget_data.csv). The dataset is composed of two columns: `Date` and `Profit/Losses`.
  a) My script analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:
  b) The total number of months included in the dataset
  c) The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
  d) Calculate the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, then find the average of those changes
  e) The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
  f) The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire periodprint the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results
It also prints the analysis to the terminal and exports a text file with the results.  


In the PyPoll challenge, I was tasked with helping a fictional town modernize its vote counting process.  I was working with a set of poll data called [election_data.csv](PyPoll/Resources/election_data.csv). The dataset is composed of three columns: `Voter ID`, `County`, and `Candidate`. My Python script analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:
  a)The total number of votes cast
  b) A complete list of candidates who received votes
  c) The percentage of votes each candidate won
  d) The total number of votes each candidate won
  e) The winner of the election based on popular vote.
It also prints the analysis to the terminal and exports a text file with the results.
